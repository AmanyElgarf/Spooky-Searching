Test plan:

1) TEST(1) use a single process/thread
	a. list of 10
	b. list of 50
	c. list of 250
	d. list of 500
	e. list of 1000
	f. list of 5000
	g. list of 10000
	h. list of 20000
TEST(1) is used to to compare how long it takes a single process/thread to iterate through different lengths of lists in search for a target value. In other words, It is used to measure how time increases as we increase the size of the list per process/thread. It is also used to determine whether process or thead is faster when both run on a list of the same size.
	
2) TEST(2) list of 250 elements 
	a. split into lists of size 5
	b. split into lists of size 10
	c. split into lists of size 25
TEST(2) is used to see how creating more processes and threads will affect the time to find the target value in a small list of numbers (250 elements)
		
3) TEST(3) list of 5000 elements
	a. split into lists of size 1000
	b. split into lists of size 500
	c. split into lists of size 250
	d. split into lists of size 10
TEST(3) is used to see how creating more processes and threads will affect the time to find the target value in a medium list of numbers (5000 elements)

4) TEST(4) list of 10000 elements
	a. split into lists of size 2000
	b. split into lists of size 1000
	c. split into lists of size 500
	d. split into lists of size 250
	e. split into lists of size 100
TEST(4) is used to see how creating more processes and threads will affect the time to find the target value in a large list of numbers (10000 elements)
		
5) TEST(5) list of 20000 elements 
	a. split into lists of size 5000
	b. split into lists of size 2000
	c. split into lists of size 1000
	d. split into lists of size 500
	e. split into lists of size 100
TEST(5) is used to see whether threads or processes will be faster in iterating through a very large list of numbers broken up into 50000, 2000, 1000, 500 or 100 processes/threads
