Testcases:

Test to see whether process or thread will run faster for:
	1) list of 250 elements 
		a. split into lists of size 5
		b. split into lists of size 10
		c. split into lists of size 25
		d. use a single process/thread
	2) list of 5000 elements
		a. split into lists of size 10
		b. split into lists of size 250
		c. split into lists of size 1000
		d. use a single process/thread
	3) list of 20000 elements 
		a. split into lists of size 10
		b. split into lists of size 1000
		c. split into lists of size 20000
		d. use a single process/thread  
		
Testing 1a-1c to see how creating more processes and threads will affect the time to find the target value in a small list of numbers (250 elements)

Testing 2a-2c to see how a medium size list broken up into 500, 20 and 5 threads/processes can result in either a faster search for threads or processes

Testing 3a-3c to see whether threads or processes will be faster in iterating through a large list of numbers broken up into 2000, 20, or 10 processes/threads

Testing 1d,2d,3d to compare how long it takes a single process/thread to iterate through different lengths of lists in search for a target value
